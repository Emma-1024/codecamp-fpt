Hi, I'm emma.
I'm glad to participate in this codecamp with everyone.
Sometimes, I enjoy being outdoors, ✈️traveling the world with friends, experiencing the beauty of nature🏞️, and capturing special moments through photography📸 during each trip. I also have a fondness for hiking🥾 and playing badminton🏸.

Other times, I prefer being indoors. I find contentment in sitting in front of the computer💻,  listening to music🎧, and watching talk🎙️ shows and movies🍿.
